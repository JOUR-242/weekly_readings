DATA VISUALIZATION PROJECT

You are to investigate a programmatic tool for creating data visualizations for the web. Examples are:
• ModestMaps
• Timeline.js
• JQuery Sparklines
• D3
• Chart.js
• HighCharts

Tools that do not require any programming (for example, you upload a csv and check some settings) are not eligible.


You will do two things:
1. Create a Wiki detailing the tool:
	• What the tool is and why it is used 
	• Where to get the tool
	• What is needed to make the tool work (software, downloads, libraries, etc.) and where you get that
	• Show and describe an example or two of how the tool (or similar) has been used journalistically/in advertising/etc.
	• Walk the reader through an example - show how to do something basic with the tool
	• Explain the limitations of the tool
	• Provide any additional resources


2. Demonstrate the tool by creating a data visualization
	• To answer the above questions, you will use the tool to create a data visualization. 
	• You should host your data visualization on your iWeb account.
	• You will have 5-8 minutes of class time the week before Spring Break to demonstrate what you made and how you made it.
